# Oppkey quarto demo for R Consortium Blog

<https://codetricity.github.io/quarto-demo/>

## Features

* R snippets rendered to chart automatically
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) example
* [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) example

## Objectives

* show stakeholders that multiple Oppkey staff can edit the content and scale the volume of content if needed
* show we can handle acceptable styling, using R Consortium logos and colors
  * we need to [edit the quarto themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#theme-options)
* illustrate that infrastructure can scale.  Currently on GitHub Pages, but we can deploy to Netlify as an alternate example

## How to Edit

* add new posts in the `posts` folder
* posts are rendered to `docs` folder
* push up to GitHub to publish to GitHub Pages

## Notes

* Used R Studio on Windows 11 (not WSL) as I ran into problems with WSL and VS Code
* installed tidyverse through the R Studio interface
